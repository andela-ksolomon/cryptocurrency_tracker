### Description
As cryptocurrencies continue to grow in popularity, the value of cryptocurrencies can vary greatly over time. If you’re lucky, some coins bought for a handful of dollars a few years ago can be worth thousands of dollars now. As a developer, you may be interested in building cryptocurrency apps. Fortunately, you can have access to the data surrounding the current cryptocurrencies via a free API from CryptoCompare that will provide you with everything you would probably ever need.

In this tutorial, we’ll be looking at building a cryptocurrency tracker that helps us keep track of 5 popular cryptocurrencies price value in USD and EURO. We’ll be using Vue.js as a lot of good things are being said about it on the web, with it apparently being faster than React, with its implementation of Snabbdom, a simple and powerful Virtual DOM focused on performance. On top of that is notably smaller than React sitting around 14kb.

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
